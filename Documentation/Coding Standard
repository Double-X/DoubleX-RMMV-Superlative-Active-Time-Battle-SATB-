Anonymous Function
An anonymous function passing the configurable object, DoubleX_RMMV.SATB, will be used to wrap the whole plugin implementation.

Extending Functions
A container per class, DoubleX_RMMV.SATB.Class, will be used to store all the original versions of functions that are extended.

Function Length
1 liners are highly discouraged although sometimes inevitable.
Functions with 10 LoC or below are desirabled and recommended, although those with 20 LoC are still somehow tolerable.
Writing functions with 20more than 20 LoC should be backed up with very solid reasons.

Functional Style
Prefer functional and declarative over procedural and imperative style, but the opposite is also acceptable.

Strict Mode
Strict mode will be used in both the configurable object, DoubleX_RMMV.SATB, and the anonymous function wrapping the whole plugin
implementation.

Style
Sticks to the JSDoc style, but also add these:
functionName = function() { // Hotspot/Potential Hotspot
    // How this function serves it intent
    functionContents;
    //
}; // functionName
It's to:
1. Indicate whether a function's normally a hotspot or can be a hotspot in rare cases, which is useful in determining whether
   performance optimizations at the cost of some other important code qualities are warranted.
2. Indicate the end of function functionName, which is useful if it's a long function.
