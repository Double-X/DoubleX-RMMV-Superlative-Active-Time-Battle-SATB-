 *    ## Parameter/Configurations Info
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # General
 *      The below points apply to all parameters/configurations unless stated
 *      otherwise:
 *      1. If the value of a parameter's empty, its configuration counterpart
 *         in the configuration plugin will be used instead
 *         (Reference tag: PARAMETERS_CONFIGURATIONS)
 *         - E.g.: Setting the parameter IsCoreEnabled as empty means that the
 *                 configuration IsCoreEnabled will be used instead
 *      2. Operators + and - are associative chaining rules, whereas *, /, %
 *         and = aren't
 *         Associative operators run faster(higher and more stable FPS) but
 *         only non associative ones support the last arguments of NOTEX in
 *         the configuration plugin
 *         (Reference tag: ASSOCIATIVE_CHAINING_RULE)
 *      3. If the value of a parameter is the contents of a function using
 *         switches/variablees, all those switches/variables must be
 *         explicitly written as $gameSwitches.value(x) or
 *         $gameVariables.value(x), where x must be a Number literal instead
 *         of a variable, unless _isAlwaysRecacheAllSwitchVars is ON
 *         (Reference tag: SWITCH_VAR)
 *      4. If a notetag chaining rule is invalid, it'll default to "first"
 *         (Reference tag: DEFAULT_CHAINING_RULE_FIRST)
 *      5. (Advanced)The this pointer referring to the battler involved as the
 *         function contexts are Game_Battler.prototype
 *         (Reference tag: THIS_GAME_BATTLER)
 *      6. (Advanced)Don't change the name nor the ordering of any function
 *         arguments unless you really know what you're truly doing
 *      7. (Advanced)The functions supposedly to return a value should be
 *         Nullipotent
 *      8. (Advanced)Returning highly nondeterministic values like random ones
 *         will have to manually invalidate the corresponding cache first or
 *         those values might be ignored due to the cached ones being used
 *         (Setting _isNoteCached on will free you from doing this, but can
 *         have very severe performance penalties if you use lots of notetags)
 *         This includes frequently changing the states of the game switches
 *         and the values of the game variables used by the notetags
 *         The similar issues present for some of the parameters storing
 *         function contents with _isParamFuncCached, even though the
 *         following are never cached regardless of the values of
 *         _isParamFuncCached:
 *        - Any parameter enabling/disabling a module/the whole plugin
 *          (NONE OF THEM SHOULD BE CHANGED DURING THE SAME BATTLE AFTER ALL)
 *      9. (Advanced)_alwaysRecacheAllSwitchVars should be set on only if you
 *         change from using some switch/variables to using some others or
 *         from not using those to using those or vice versa, without wanting
 *         to explicitly update the switch/variable note factor mapping
 *         yourselves(setting this on might have performance penalties)
 *    # Additional Descriptions
 *      Core Module:
 *      1. _isParamFuncCached
 *         Setting it on is more advnatageous when most of the parameter
 *         functions are costly to run, but more disadvantageous otherwise
 *      2. _isNoteCached
 *         This should be set on in general, especially when many script/eval
 *         notetags are used, but can be set off if only a few notetags are
 *         used, all being val, switch, var or cfg with simple functions
 *      3. IsCoreEnabled
 *      4. _coreBaseFillUnit
 *      5. coreBaseFillATBFrame
 *      6. coreBaseFillATBSec
 *      7. _coreTurnUnit
 *      8. coreTurnATBTime
 *         None
 *      9. coreTurnATBAct
 *         Forced actions won't update the battle turn clock action counter
 *      10. canCoreTurnClockOverflow
 *          The battle turn clock consists of 3 units:
 *          - Number of actions executed
 *          - Number of frames elapsed
 *          - Number of seconds elapsed
 *          While only 1 of those units will determine whether the turn's
 *          ended, all these units are always updated, so it's possible that
 *          changing the battle turn clock unit during the same battle can
 *          lead to using the new unit counter way exceeding its maximum
 *          If canCoreTurnClockOverflow returns a truthy result, the
 *          proportion of that amount exceeding the maximum relative to that
 *          maximum will become the progress of the new battle turn
 *          E.g.:
 *          - If the frame unit counter exceeded the maximum by 50%, then the
 *            next turn will be 50% shorter than normal in this case
 *      11. coreMaxATBVal
 *      12. _coreMaxATBValNoteChainingRule
 *      13. _coreMaxATBValNotePriorities
 *      14. _coreActStateNoteChainingRule
 *          None
 *      (v0.01a+)Hotkey Module:
 *      1. IsHotkeyEnabled
 *      2. prevInputableActorKey
 *         If the leftmost actor's reached by trying to select a new inputable
 *         actor and that actor's not inputable, the search will continue from
 *         the rightmost actor, until a new inputable actor's found or the one
 *         just at the right of the currently selected one's reached
 *         DON'T RETURN A DIFFERENT KEYBOARD MAPPING DURING THE SAME BATTLE
 *         UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING
 *      3. nextInputableActorKey
 *         If the rightmost actor's reached by trying to select a new
 *         inputable actor and that actor's not inputable, the search will
 *         continue from the leftmost actor, until a new inputable actor's
 *         found or the one just at the left of the currently selected one's
 *         reached
 *         DON'T RETURN A DIFFERENT KEYBOARD MAPPING DURING THE SAME BATTLE
 *         UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING
 *      4. inputableActorKeys
 *         The ith element of the returned String Array is the hotkey to
 *         select the ith party member if that party member's inputable
 *         DON'T RETURN A DIFFERENT KEYBOARD MAPPING LIST DURING THE SAME
 *         BATTLE UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING

 *    # Examples
 *      Core Module:
 *      1. IsCoreEnabled
 *         Setting IsCoreEnabled as return false; will disable this plugin
 *      2. coreBaseFillATBFrame
 *         Setting coreBaseFillATBFrame as return 300; will set the base time
 *         to fully fill battler ATB values as 300 ATB frames(An ATB frame's a
 *         frame with an ATB frame update)
 *         This parameter's effective only when _coreBaseFillUnit is set as
 *         coreBaseFillATBFrame
 *      3. coreBaseFillATBSec
 *         Setting coreBaseFillATBSec as return 10; will set the base time

 *         This parameter's effective only when _coreBaseFillUnit is set as
 *         coreBaseFillATBSec
 *      4. coreTurnATBTime
 *         If _coreBaseFillUnit is set as coreBaseFillATBFrame and
 *         coreBaseFillATBFrame is set as return 600;, then setting
 *         coreTurnATBTime as return baseFillATB * 1.5; will set the turn
 *         duration as 600 * 1.5 = 900 ATB frames
 *      5. coreTurnATBAct
 *         Setting coreTurnATBAct as
 *         return BattleManager.allBattleMembers().length; will cause the
 *         turn to consist of the number of turns equal to that of all battler
 *      6. canCoreTurnClockOverflow
 *         Setting canCoreTurnClockOverflow as return true; will cause the
 *         current turn progress clock based on time/action to overflow to
 *         next turn(If the counter and max was 15 and 10 respectively, then
 *         new turn will immediately come with the current turn/action
 *         counter becoming roughly 15 - 10 = 5)
 *      7. coreMaxATBVal
 *         Setting coreMaxATBVal as return 200.0; will cause the maximum ATB

 *         key whose mapping is 'left' to be the hotkey for selecting the
 *         inputable actor whose party index's just smaller than the currently
 *         selected one(the search will continue until the one whose party
 *         index's just larger than the currently selected one's checked)
 *      3. nextInputableActorKey
 *         Setting prevUnputableActorKey as return 'right'; will set the
 *         key whose mapping is 'right' to be the hotkey for selecting the
 *         inputable actor whose party index's just larger than the currently
 *         selected one(the search will continue until the one whose party
 *         index's just smaller than the currently selected one's checked)

 *         return ['#1', '#2', '#3', '#4', '#5', '#6', '#7', '#8', '#9', '#10'];
 *         will set the key whose mapping is '#i' to be the hotkey for
