Approach
The system development consists of the below 5 levels:
1. Top Level - Identifiying the situation underlying this system, the goal of this system, the conditions to be met to achieve
               the goal and the constraints to be conformed with to avoid the undesirables
2. High Level - Constructing the feature set architectures and structures, and organizing the users' freedom and control over
                the configurables
3. Mid Level - Building the plugin info and user configuration region
4. Low Level - Planning the implementation codebase patterns and templates
5. Bottom Level - Writing the implementation codebase
No levels will ever be finished - All of them will be constantly reviewed and revised
The system testing consists of the below 3 levels:
1. Unit testing - An unit test will be run for every standalone unit
2. Integration testing - An integration test will be run for every standalone feature
3. System testing - A system test will be run for the whole plugin
